# Reminder CLI Assignment

Assignment description: 
> For this assignment, you are in charge of building a **Reminder CLI application** using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
> You're going to complete a **command-line reminder application** that lets users:

> * Add reminders with descriptions and tags
> * View all reminders grouped by category
> * Search for specific reminders
> * Mark reminders as complete/incomplete
> * Modify existing reminders

This project teaches how to structure code with proper separation of concerns, making it more maintainable over time.
