# Week 1 - Agile Software Development (Pt. 1)
Topics:

    * Introduction to Agile Principles
    * Lean Canvas

## I. Introduction to Agile Principles 
>"The Agile methodology is an approach that divides work into phases, emphasizing continuous delivery and improvement.  
>Agile benefits teams by enabling adaptive planning, rapid execution, and ongoing evaluation, leading to more responsive and successful outcomes."

Two ways to solve a problem:

1. **Defined process**

    * Command and Control
    * Plan in detail
    * Enforce the plan
    * Control changes

2. **Empirical process**

    * Learn as we go
    * Changes happens
    * Embrace changes
    * Inspect and adapt

### Types of agile:

* DevOps
* Design Thinking
* SCRUM
* Extreme Programming(XP)
* Kanban

note*: agile != fast

### Value - Agile Manifesto

* **Individual and interactions** _over_ processes and tools
* **Working software** _over_ comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** _over_ contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** _over_ following a plan

Agile principle: #FailFast  
    Action > long discussion test-driven development continuous integration

## II. Lean canvas

A Lean Canvas is a one-page business plan template for startups, focusing on quickly mapping and testing key assumptions about a business idea, prioritizing problems, solutions, customers, and risks over lengthy traditional plans.

### The 9 Blocks of the Lean Canvas:

1. **Problem** (What problem are you solving?)
    * Example: Friends arguing over who owes what after group trips.

2. **Customer Segments** (Who experiences this problem?)
    * Example: College students who frequently travel in groups.

3. **Unique Value Proposition** (Why should users choose your product?)
    * Example: “Split group expenses instantly—no awkward follow-ups.”

4. **Solution** (How you solve the problem.)
    * Top features only
    * Example: Automatic expense splitting and real-time balance tracking.

5. **Channels** (How customers discover and access your product.)
    * Example: App Store searches and student word-of-mouth.

6. **Revenue Streams** (How the business makes money.)
    * Example: Freemium model with a paid premium plan.

7. **Cost Structure** (Main costs to run the business.)
    * Example: Cloud hosting and payment processing fees.

8. **Key Metrics** (How success is measured.)
    * Example: Monthly active users.

9. **Unfair Advantage** (What cannot be easily copied by competitors.)
    * Example: Exclusive partnerships with university student groups.
